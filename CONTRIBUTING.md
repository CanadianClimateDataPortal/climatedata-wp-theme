# Contributing to the code

This section documents various aspects of the development process.

## Quick start

The [**_Developing with Docker Compose_**](./docs/developing-with-docker-compose.md)
document explains how to set up a Docker Compose environment for development.
If you want to develop, you should start here.

The [**_Git branching strategy_**](./docs/git-branching-strategy.md) explains
how we use Git and branches for development, when releasing versions, when
developing hot fixes, etc.

## Docker images

The [**_Portal Docker image_**](./docs/portal-docker-image) document gives more
details on the Docker image of the _Portal_. This image is used during
development, but is also deployed on our different environments, including
production.

The [**_Task Runner_**](./docs/task-runner.md) document describes the _Task
Runner_, a Docker image containing various development tools used during
development and when building the _Portal_ image.
